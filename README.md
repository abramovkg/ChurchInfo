# ChurchInfo

The ChurchInfo project is managed at Sourceforge http://sourceforge.net/projects/churchinfo/ but I try to sync this repo with every release.. this repo is used as the base code for [ChurchCRM/CRM](https://github.com/ChurchCRM/CRM)

# ChurchCRM

A new project has been forked from the stable church info project is now called Church Web CRM with the goal of bringing new featuers and creating a responsive application.
